## 3. About Project:


**Context and motivation**
- The real estate sector is constantly evolving and requires more and better solutions for finding properties.
- Currently, real estate search platforms are opting for a more traditional solution, focusing only on the physical characteristics of the property, without considering the factors related to the area where the property is located. This factor is extremely important to the client and can be the deciding factor in the final selection of the property.
- Lack of familiarity with the area can make it difficult to assess the quality of life, convenience, and suitability of the area for your particular needs. This can lead to less informed buying decisions and possibly dissatisfaction with your property choice.


**What is WisH?**
WisH: Where is Home is an innovative and personalized real estate research platform, instead of focusing only on the physical characteristics of properties, it takes into account the individual preferences of buyers, allowing them to explore areas of interest based on metrics relevant additional information, example Walk Score, Transit Score...


**Objectives**
- The main objective of WisH is to provide a personalized and innovative real estate research platform, which allows users to explore areas of interest based on metrics relevant to their lifestyle, such as Walk Score, Transit Score, and others, allowing the customers to find the best place to live according to their preferences.
- Provide a platform to real state agents to promote their properties, and to reach potential customers, based on their preferences.
